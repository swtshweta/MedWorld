/*
    Note: The CSS for this theme is located at {themedirectory}/css/style.css
    Other CSS files are there too: reset.css (which is @import'ed into style.css)
    Also there is an ie.css stylesheet. The header.php currently has a conditional
    statement for "lt IE 9" which should be adequate in most cases.
